## Installation

This guide will walk you through installing and using Motion Icons React in your project. The entire setup takes less than 2 minutes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- Node.js 14 or higher installed
- A React project (16.8+ for hooks support)
- Basic familiarity with React components

### Step 1: Install the Package

Install both Motion Icons React and Lucide React using your preferred package manager:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @motion-icons/react lucide-react
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @motion-icons/react lucide-react
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @motion-icons/react lucide-react
```

```bash bun
bun add @motion-icons/react lucide-react
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  **Why lucide-react?** Motion Icons React is built on top of Lucide React icons, so you'll need both packages. Lucide provides the icon shapes, while Motion Icons adds the animation layer.
</Note>

### Step 2: Import the Styles

The animations require CSS to work. Import the stylesheet in your main application file:

**Where to add this:**
- Create React App: `src/index.tsx` or `src/App.tsx`
- Next.js: `pages/_app.tsx` or `app/layout.tsx`
- Vite: `src/main.tsx`

```tsx
import '@motion-icons/react/style.css';
```

### Step 3: Use Your First Animated Icon

Now you're ready to use animated icons! Here's how to convert a regular Lucide icon to an animated one:

<CodeGroup>
```tsx Before (Lucide React)
import { Heart } from 'lucide-react';

function LikeButton() {
  return <Heart size={24} color="red" />;
}
```

```tsx After (Motion Icons React)
import { MotionIcon } from '@motion-icons/react';

function LikeButton() {
  return (
    <MotionIcon
      name="Heart"
      animation="heartbeat"
      size={24}
      color="red"
    />
  );
}
```
</CodeGroup>

**What changed?**
1. Import `MotionIcon` instead of individual icon components
2. Use the `name` prop to specify which icon (e.g., "Heart", "Star", "Bell")
3. Add the `animation` prop to choose an animation type

That's it! Your icon now has a smooth heartbeat animation.

## Try Different Animations

Motion Icons React includes 10+ built-in animations. Here are some popular ones:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Spin Animation">
    ```tsx
    <MotionIcon
      name="Loader2"
      animation="spin"
      size={24}
    />
    ```
    Perfect for loading indicators.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Bounce Animation">
    ```tsx
    <MotionIcon
      name="ArrowUp"
      animation="bounce"
      size={24}
    />
    ```
    Great for call-to-action buttons.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Pulse Animation">
    ```tsx
    <MotionIcon
      name="Bell"
      animation="pulse"
      size={24}
    />
    ```
    Ideal for notifications.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Add Entrance Effects

Entrance animations play once when the icon first appears on screen. You can combine them with regular animations:

```tsx
<MotionIcon
  name="Star"
  entrance="zoomIn"      // Plays once on mount
  animation="pulse"      // Loops continuously
  size={32}
  color="#FFD700"
/>
```

**How it works:**
1. Icon zooms in when it first appears (entrance)
2. Then continues pulsing indefinitely (animation)

## Make Icons Interactive

Control when animations play using the `trigger` prop:

```tsx
<MotionIcon
  name="Heart"
  animation="heartbeat"
  trigger="hover"        // Animation only plays on hover
  interactive           // Makes icon focusable and clickable
  size={24}
  onClick={() => console.log('Icon clicked!')}
/>
```

**Trigger options:**
- `"always"` (default): Animation plays continuously
- `"hover"`: Animation plays only when hovering
- `"click"`: Animation plays on each click
- `"focus"`: Animation plays when focused (keyboard navigation)

## Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="exclamation-triangle" title="Animations not working">
    Make sure you've imported the CSS file:
    ```tsx
    import '@motion-icons/react/style.css';
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="question-circle" title="Icon not found">
    Ensure you're using the correct Lucide icon name. Check the [Lucide icon library](https://lucide.dev/icons/) for available icons.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="info-circle" title="TypeScript errors">
    Make sure you have the latest version of TypeScript and that both packages are properly installed.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  **Pro tip:** Start with simple animations like `pulse` or `spin`, then experiment with more complex ones as you get comfortable with the library.
