## [1.0.9] - November 2025

### Critical Bug Fix: Entrance Animations

This release fixes a critical issue where entrance animations were not working properly in the npm package despite functioning correctly in the website playground.

### Problem Identified

Entrance animations were either too fast, invisible, or not playing at all in applications using the npm package:
- Animations appeared to skip or play too quickly
- Icons were visible immediately instead of animating in
- Animation timing didn't match the specified duration
- The same code worked perfectly in the website playground

### Root Cause

Three separate issues were preventing entrance animations from working:

1. **Timer Logic Error**: The `setHasEntered(true)` was being called after only `animationDelay` instead of `animationDuration + animationDelay`, causing the animation class to be removed prematurely
2. **Missing Initial Opacity**: Elements weren't starting with `opacity: 0`, making them visible before the animation began
3. **Conditional Animation Duration**: The `animationDuration` style was only applied conditionally, preventing proper override of CSS defaults

### Changes Made

#### 1. Fixed Timer Duration

**Before:**
```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (entrance) {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      setHasEntered(true);
    }, animationDelay);  // ❌ Only waits for delay!
    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  }
}, [entrance, animationDelay]);
```

**After:**
```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (entrance) {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      setHasEntered(true);
    }, animationDuration + animationDelay);  // ✅ Waits for full animation
    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  }
}, [entrance, animationDuration, animationDelay]);
```

**Why this fixes it:** The entrance animation class needs to remain applied for the entire duration of the animation. Previously, it was removed after just the delay, cutting off the animation mid-play.

#### 2. Added Initial Opacity for Entrance Animations

**Before:**
```tsx
style={{
  display: 'inline-flex',
  alignItems: 'center',
  justifyContent: 'center',
  color
}}
```

**After:**
```tsx
style={{
  display: 'inline-flex',
  alignItems: 'center',
  justifyContent: 'center',
  animationDuration: `${animationDuration}ms`,
  animationDelay: `${animationDelay}ms`,
  ...(entrance && !hasEntered && { opacity: 0 }),  // ✅ Start invisible
  color
}}
```

**Why this fixes it:** Entrance animations need the element to start invisible (`opacity: 0`) before the animation begins. The CSS keyframes animate from `opacity: 0` to `opacity: 1`, but without the initial opacity, the element appears immediately.

#### 3. Always Apply Animation Duration

**Before:**
```tsx
style={{
  ...(entrance && !hasEntered && { animationDuration: `${animationDuration}ms` }),
  ...(animationDelay > 0 && { animationDelay: `${animationDelay}ms` }),
}}
```

**After:**
```tsx
style={{
  animationDuration: `${animationDuration}ms`,  // ✅ Always applied
  animationDelay: `${animationDelay}ms`,        // ✅ Always applied
  ...(entrance && !hasEntered && { opacity: 0 }),
}}
```

**Why this fixes it:** The entrance animation CSS classes have hardcoded durations (0.8s-1s). By always applying the inline style, we ensure the user's custom `animationDuration` prop properly overrides these defaults.

### Testing Results

**Before v1.0.9:**
- ❌ Entrance animations not visible or too fast
- ❌ Icons appear immediately instead of animating
- ❌ Custom timing not respected
- ✅ Works in website playground

**After v1.0.9:**
- ✅ Entrance animations work properly
- ✅ Icons start invisible and animate in
- ✅ Custom duration and delay respected
- ✅ Matches website playground behavior
- ✅ Works in React, Next.js, and Vite

### Migration Guide

If you're upgrading from v1.0.8 or earlier:

1. **Update the package:**
   ```bash
   npm install motion-icons-react@latest
   ```

2. **Clear build cache:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules/.cache
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Hard refresh browser:**
   - Windows/Linux: Ctrl + Shift + R
   - Mac: Cmd + Shift + R

No code changes are required in your application. All entrance animations will now work as expected.

### Example

```tsx
<MotionIcon
  name="Heart"
  entrance="fadeInUp"        // Now works correctly!
  animationDuration={1000}   // Duration is respected
  animationDelay={200}       // Delay works properly
/>
```

### Files Changed

- `npm-motion-icons/src/components/MotionIcon.tsx` - Fixed entrance animation logic

## [1.0.3] - October 2025

### Critical Bug Fix: Next.js Animation Support

This release fixes a critical issue where animations were not working in Next.js applications despite working perfectly in regular React apps.

### Problem Identified

Animations appeared static in Next.js applications even though:
- CSS was loaded correctly
- Classes were applied to elements
- DevTools showed `animation: running`
- No console errors were present

### Root Cause

Tailwind CSS utility classes were conflicting with CSS animation transforms. The component was using Tailwind classes like `inline-flex items-center justify-center` which set CSS properties that interfered with the animation's `transform` property.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Removed Conflicting Tailwind Classes

**Before:**
```tsx
className={cn(
  'inline-flex items-center justify-center',  // Conflicting classes
  interactive && 'cursor-pointer transition-transform duration-200',
  shouldAnimate && animationClass,
  className
)}
```

**After:**
```tsx
className={cn(
  shouldAnimate && animationClass,  // Animation class first
  interactive && 'cursor-pointer',  // Removed transition-transform
  className
)}
style={{
  display: 'inline-flex',           // Moved to inline styles
  alignItems: 'center',
  justifyContent: 'center',
}}
```

**Why this fixes it:** Tailwind's utility classes can override CSS animation properties. Moving layout properties to inline styles prevents conflicts and ensures animation classes have proper specificity.

#### 2. Fixed SSR Hydration Issue

**Before:**
```tsx
const [isAnimating, setIsAnimating] = useState(trigger === 'always');
```

**After:**
```tsx
const [isAnimating, setIsAnimating] = useState(false);

useEffect(() => {
  if (trigger === 'always') {
    setIsAnimating(true);
  }
}, [trigger]);
```

**Why this fixes it:** Prevents hydration mismatch between server and client, ensures animations start after component mounts, and provides better Next.js SSR compatibility.

#### 3. Improved Trigger Logic

**Before:**
```tsx
const shouldAnimate = isAnimating && animation !== 'none';
```

**After:**
```tsx
const shouldAnimate = (trigger === 'always' || isAnimating) && animation !== 'none';
```

**Why this fixes it:** The `trigger="always"` now applies animation immediately without waiting for state update, making continuous animations more reliable.

#### 4. Removed Inline Animation Duration Override

**Before:**
```tsx
style={{
  animationDuration: `${animationDuration}ms`,  // Always applied
  animationDelay: `${animationDelay}ms`,
}}
```

**After:**
```tsx
style={{
  ...(entrance && !hasEntered && { animationDuration: `${animationDuration}ms` }),
  ...(animationDelay > 0 && { animationDelay: `${animationDelay}ms` }),
}}
```

**Why this fixes it:** Inline styles have higher specificity than CSS classes. The CSS defines animations as `infinite`, but inline style was overriding this. Now only applies duration for entrance animations where needed.

### Testing Results

**Before v1.0.3:**
- Works in React
- Static in Next.js
- Static in Next.js + Tailwind

**After v1.0.3:**
- Works in React
- Works in Next.js
- Works in Next.js + Tailwind
- Works with Turbopack 
- Works with SSR

### Migration Guide

If you're upgrading from v1.0.2:

1. **Update the package:**
   ```bash
   npm install motion-icons-react@latest
   ```

2. **Clear Next.js cache (recommended):**
   ```bash
   rm -rf .next
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Hard refresh browser:**
   - Windows/Linux: Ctrl + Shift + R
   - Mac: Cmd + Shift + R

No code changes are required in your application.

### Technical Details

The problem was a CSS specificity conflict where Tailwind utility classes interfered with animation transforms. By moving non-animation styles to inline styles (which have highest specificity), we ensure:
- Layout styles don't interfere with animations
- Animation classes work consistently
- No conflicts with Tailwind or other CSS frameworks

### Files Changed

- `src/components/MotionIcon.tsx` - Main component fix
- `src/animations/animations.css` - Enhanced animation keyframes
- `package.json` - Version bump to 1.0.3

## Migration Guides

### From Beta to v1.0.0

No breaking changes! The API is fully backward compatible.

**Recommended updates:**
```tsx
// Old (still works)
<MotionIcon name="Heart" animation="pulse" />

// New (with entrance effect)
<MotionIcon 
  name="Heart" 
  animation="pulse" 
  entrance="fadeIn" 
/>
```
